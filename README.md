## About

Recent Minecraft versions added new methods of automating your food productions. But:

* Isn't it too easy to eat industrial Dried Kelp all the time?
* Aren't Hoglin farms just blatantly broken?
* Doesn't the game get boring if you only munch villager-traded Golden Carrots?

The solution is well known by now:

As you eat food, the nutrition value of the different kinds of food will decrease, so you're forced to have a diverse diet.

By default, the last 20 meals are considered when calculating the nutrition values and the drop in the nutrition will be pretty rapid.

If you're not a friend of that, then rest assured,
_all used formulas are totally configurable._
You can either edit the config file manually or use ModMenu to access the config screen.

## Carrot Mode

There's also the so-called "Carrot Mode" which is highly inspired by [Spice Of Life: Carrot Edition](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/spice-of-life-carrot-edition)

For everyone who doesn't know the concept:

One starts with a lower than regular amount of hearts and through eating diverse foods you unlock more hearts.

_This too, is highly configurable._
